# pacemaker_gui
A GUI created to control and monitor pacemaker activity. 

This GUI was created as a part of the course SWRENG 3K04 - Software Development. 

The GUI allows for 10 users to register. The user can pick between 10 pacing modes and set the appropriate parameters according to provided documentation. Serial Communication with the pacemaker device was also implemented so that the activity of the heart and pacemaker could be plotted in real time. 

This project uses the PySimpleGUI library to create the interface, the pandas and numpy libraries to set the parameter ranges, and the matplotlib and serial libraries to implment the live plotting.
