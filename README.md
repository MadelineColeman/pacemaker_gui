# pacemaker_gui
A GUI created to control and monitor pacemaker activity. 

This GUI was created as a part of the course SWRENG 3K04 - Software Development. 

The GUI allows for 10 users to register. The user can pick between 10 pacing modes and set the appropriate parameters.

Serial Communication with the pacemaker device was also implemented so that the activity of the heart and pacemaker could be plotted in real time.
